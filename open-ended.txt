Q1: How does cron scheduling work? Show a crontab entry to run a script every 5 minutes.
Cron is a Linux time-based job scheduler. It runs commands or scripts automatically at specified times.
*/5 * * * * /usr/bin/python3  

Q2: Why do we need log rotation? Show an example logrotate config for temperature.log.
if we recieve too much data it will fill up the disk, slow down the system and become to large to analyze
so the rotation deletes the very old data, archiving old logs the old data and compress them
 and starting fresh logs automatically 
example : 
/home/peter/iot_logger/logs/temperature.log {
    size 1M
    compress
    copytruncate
    missingok
    notifempty
    rotate 5
}

Q3: Explain the difference between a Virtual Machine and a Container. Must containers use the same OS as the host? Why or why not?
Virtual Machine: 1- runs a full guest OS (e.g., Linux, Windows)
                 2- needs a hypervisor like VirtualBox
                 3- uses more RAM/CPU
                 4- slow
Container: 1- shares the host OS kernel
           2- runs on container engine like docker
           3- only runs the app and its dependencies
           4- Fast
           5- can run more than one container on the same kernel so we can save huge space
Containers do not need the same OS distribution, but they must use the same kernel.
which means they must be Linux if the host is Linux. 

Q4: Reflection: Which actions in this project combined multiple Linux concepts (e.g., redirection + process monitoring)? How does this apply to real IoT systems?
Redirection & Pipes :   file.log, 2>&1
                        ls | grep .py

Environment Variables : like we can store sensor readings in some variable like export temp_sensor=temperature

Background Processes : python3 script.py & , to can control the terminal 

Log Rotation : To prevent logs from filling the disk and analyze the fresh data

Text Processing & Filtering: grep, awk, cat, tail

its all important in IoT to :
1- Reliability = Background + Cron + Log Rotation
2- Automation = Scripts + Environment Variables
3- Monitoring = Process Control + File Descriptors
4- Efficiency = Redirection + Text Processing
